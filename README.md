# Noah's Computational Musicology Project
Spotipy computational musicology playground for coursework
I have three different corpus ideas. 
# Corpus Selection: Bach

Starting with the first, I have many different recordings of Bach's Well Tempered Clavier Prelude in C Major (BWV 846), performed by different people on piano. I would like to see how they vary in terms of tempo, key (is someone using A=415?), and emotional valence
### Atypical tracks
"Bach Eternal"'s track is played on harp! It also appears to be an arrangement, it is much longer, it has a repeat up an octave. Axel Gillison's performance is at half tempo! Andras Schiff's recording also includes the fugue, which is frustrating. Jacques Loussier's is a jazzy arrangement including other instruments. Maybe this should be removed from the corpus? It's definitely the most atypical, but also the most interesting.
Secondly, I have many recordings of the aria to Bach's Goldberg Variations. Some of these aren't played on keyboard instruments. I would love to see how the spotify data varies against each recording, but I suspect that there may not be enough data points to be meaningful.

Some interesting questions about Bach: Is there a measurable difference between Glenn Gould and other recording artists for Bach?
### Atypical tracks 
James Ritchman's recording is on harpsichord. The sitkovetsky is an arrangement for strings. As is the Les Violions du Roy. Finch is performed on Harp!
# Corpus Selection: Music for Dogs/Cats/Frogs/etc...
Thirdly, in this process of research, I found many playlists such as "music for cats" "music for dogs", etc. I would like to see how these vary.  
## Music for Frogs
https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6G6qnBVUORSeTf4kA7vC22?si=f955273454d548bf
This corpus seems to be be very rock ish, with punchy rhythms. What makes it frog music, I'm not sure.
## Music for Cats
https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7gfsHECGdEKU7dFQEQCh1p?si=afd64583406f4dd8
It's supposed to be relaxing, classical choices.

## Soothing music for Rabbits
https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2JKtxntKKWXm5K9F1jEfC4?si=a2bed427a0a94c7d
This seems to include albums specifically designed/marketed for rabbits. 

## Music for Dogs   
https://open.spotify.com/playlist/48DvsLs8VirGB4BnCYWl2x?si=f9ee9cff4fcd4c21
Supposed to be "stress reduction and anxiety relaxation to calm down dogs and puppies"

## Reggae for Dogs  
https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4CHnPKSVHnze8p1FaVOZeB?si=d7010fb4a8944112
"Calming reggae music for anxious pups"
So, corpus question, how does "Music for Dogs" compare to "Reggae for Dogs"? 
I didn't know that dog anxiety was such a big problem, but there is a lot of well-subscribed music for it.
