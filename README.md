Spotipy computational musicology playground for coursework
I have three different corpus ideas. 
## Corpus Selection: Bach
Starting with the first, I have many different recordings of Bach's Well Tempered Clavier Prelude in C Major (BWV 846), performed by different people on piano. I would like to see how they vary in terms of tempo, key (is someone using A=415?), and emotional valence
Secondly, I have many recordings of the aria to Bach's Goldberg Variations. Some of these aren't played on keyboard instruments. I would love to see how the spotify data varies against each recording, but I suspect that there may not be enough data points to be meaningful.
## Corpus Selection: Music for Dogs
Thirdly, in this process of research, I found many playlists such as "music for cats" "music for dogs", etc. I would like to see how these vary.  

Some interesting questions about Bach: Is there a measurable difference between Glenn Gould and other recording artists for Bach?
